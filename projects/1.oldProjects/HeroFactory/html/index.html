                  with other such artists. Under the creation of Kire L. Elrid,
                  <em>Hero Factory</em> is similar to that of a job board; where
                  <b
                    >people can post project ideas they want to carry out and
                    those looking for work and experience can offer their

                  you can seek out someone who needs your skill set and gain
                  experience from their project. If you have an idea but are
                  unable to get help from experts, there are lots of artists in
                  the world who have potential waiting to be unlocked.

                <p>
                  Have you ever wanted to create an enthralling work of art, but
                  never knew where to begin or lacked confidence to start?
                  <b
                    >Day Dream Productions (DDP) is a website that helps users
                    visualize the piece of art they want to create!</b
                  >
                  To start, DDP supplies a variety of prompts and questions to
                  spark imagination. The website then displays the userâ€™s
                  responses in an organized outline. Finally, the result of the
                  exercise is saved onto their account for further
                  contemplation.<br /><br>
                  While this website is still under construction, DDP is
                  intended to motivate anyone to create. You don't have to have
                  the skills or the experiences (not yet at least). All you need
                  right now is permission from yourself to dream something, plan
                  something, and create something.
