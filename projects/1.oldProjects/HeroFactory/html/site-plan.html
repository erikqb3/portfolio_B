      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr />
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        Hero Factory is a website where artists who strive to create wholesome,
        uplifting, and awesome art can connect with other such artists. Under
        the creation of Kire L. Elrid, Hero Factory is similar to that of a job
        board; people can post project ideas they want to carry out and those
        looking for work and experience can offer their service. The website
        will have links that send users to various pages where they can learn
        more about the creator of the website and his work, connect with others,
        provide and introduction of their selves, get recommendations to
        different motivational and helpful resources, and day-dream their
        starting project ideas.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        My audience will consist of artists that strive to create wholesome,
        uplifting, and awesome art and need help in their projects. A vast
        majority of them will be English speakers ranging from young middle
        schoolers to college students and beyond. Most of them would access the
        web page in search of either a proposed project they can contribute
        their talents to, other artists to recruit for the making of their own
        projects, or simply inspiration and a better understanding in order to
        improve their work. Most important of all is that they are people who
        share similar values and morals pertaining to wholesome art and want to
        connect with others to support them in their standards.<br /><br />

      <p>
        <b>Why will people come to my site?</b>People will come to my site
        because they are in search of two things. One is that they are looking
        for projects of others that they can offer their service and talents to
        in order to develop their own artistic skills and gain experience
        working with others. The other thing they are looking for are fellow
        artists that share the same standards and values as they do in terms of
        virtuous art. There is an increasing amount of inappropriate content
        being fed into the entertainment and media industry; which gives reason
        for those who want to provide the world with better to conjoin together
        and support each other in their united and personal endeavors to create
        good art.<br /><br />
        <b
          >What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for
          them?</b
        >
        Visitors will come to my website with questions such as “who can help me
        in my project”, “who is providing a project idea that I can offer my
        talents to in order to gain experience and connections”, and “who else
        is there that shares similar standards in terms of wholesome
        entertainment and the importance of?” In essence, the main purpose of
        this website is to help others find out who’s out there.<br />
        Other questions that visitors might have would involve what’s out there.
        “What can help me get out of my artistic rut?” “What is something others
        are doing that I can learn from and apply?” “What’s a good idea I can
        come up with or build off of?”
        <br /><br />
        <b
          >What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your
          site?</b
        >
        My website will involve the activity of interacting with others. People
        can pitch out project ideas and ask for individuals with specific
        experiences and skill sets. They can also offer suggestions of what has
        helped them in their artistic journey and their comments on other’s
        suggestions. They can also provide introductory information about
        themselves, samples of their own work, and contact information so that
        they can assist those that are searching.<br />
        Along with the activity of interacting is the activity of learning.
        Visitors can learn from the work of others (via Contributors’
        Introductions) and discover what works for them and what they can apply
        into their own work.
        <br /><br />
        <b
          >What information is necessary to complete any actions your site
          offers?</b
        >
        In order to be a full contributor of the website, a person needs to
        register themselves which involves creating an introduction post. The
        introduction post will ask questions such as “What kind of art do you
        specialize in?”, “How long have you been working with this art medium?”,
        “Are you self-taught or do you have professional training? (ie
        college)”, “Are you a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
        Saints?”. and other questions that provide viewers to figure out how
        good you are and if you are someone they would want to work with. Those
        making an introduction post must also post samples of their work
        (whether it be a word/PDF document, a picture, audio, video, etc. They
        can also choose whether or not to add links to their own personal social
        media pages; but despite whether or not they want to, they must provide
        some samples of their work to show to others that they are legit.
        <br /><br />
        <b
          >Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get
          this information or complete the actions?</b
        >
        Visitors will come to my site instead of another’s because along with
        providing invitations from others to join in on projects, my website
        focuses on artists who stand firm in their standards of wholesome and
        uplifting art. Those who do not promote pornography, vulgar language,
        disturbing imagery, controversy arguments, and other displeasing aspects
        that pollutes the entertainment and media people (especially youth)
        consume.

        Hi! My name is Kire L. Elrid. Though I am an animator by trade, I also
        have experience with creative writing, illustration, music composing and
        performing, and web design. Refering back to animating, I got my degree
        in [Animations from BYU/Art with an emphasis in illustrations from
        BYU-Idaho]. I've worked in several animation industries that focused on
        2D cartoon animations for children's programs.
