The almighty Crescent River flowed through the center of the wood, and along the embankments, many small villages, towns, and even a city at the joining of the Slipclaw and Tremont rivers into the Crescent. Despite these many settlements, some chose to live on their own among the peaceable, if perilous, creatures of the forest, among the emerald leaves of summer, among the scent of garcei flowers, alone with the wind and one with nature.</p><p>The sun had just risen over the canopy, and the plump wellings warbled their songs from their mud nests in the creeks. They sang for the delicious grass growing on the field and between the stones of the creek. Others sung for the delectable spix that floated with the glinting Dust that filled the air. And yet other wellings sang for the Dust that settled on and warmed their mud brown feathers.</p><p>Some abruptly quacked and dove under the water at the rush of paws along a riverbank. A pack of quartolf rushed by and howled at the sight of sauntering ajax, and in their pursuit, separatedthe sunlight into rainbow streams with their crystalline hides. The ajax broke branches from the trees with its enormous antlers as a means of hindering the quartolf and churned up the soil with its sharpened hooves to trip their paws. After minutes of pursuit, a quartolf lunged, the ajax wailed and tumbled. The Quartolf had their meal.</p><p>Deep beneath the earth, a golem slumbered still, turning about and shaking the stones above.Peblud skittered away under their mineral shells, afraid of an earthquake squashing their exoskeletons. A net swept across them and scooped them up. They writhed and squirmed to escape the threads, all to no avail. The net swung level with the squinting eyes of a young boy, no more than ten. He scrunched his nose. “Rocks with legs.” He stuck out his tongue. “And Ma wants to make soup out of them.” He hitched the net over his shoulder and paced away from the gravel field and toward a glade beyond the next rows of trees. “Those quartolf are lucky…”</p><p>He hiked up his loose-fitting trousers and stuffed the loose coattail of his red shirt into them, then harrumphed and ran toward the trees, narrowly avoiding stepping on the laces trailing on his shoes. He emerged into the glade and hop-skipped over the pond the pet wellings loungedin. </p><p>The cabin beyond the lake stood at a single level, with a loft at the top forming a peak. Greenish smoke drifted from the chimney and spread Dust from the concentrated sparkwood across the glade, causing hundreds of garcei blooms to sprout.</p><p>The boy hurriedly ran around back to the wooden slat fence and stone groundwork at the back of the cabin. Curled up underneath a low roof was a ball of sleek, black fur, roughly as large as the boy himself.</p><p>The boy peeked through the slats and grinned, pulling a peblud out from the net. “Kairus…” he said in a drawn-out way.

The almighty Crescent River flowed through the center of the wood, and along the embankments, many small villages, towns, and even a city at the joining of the Slipclaw and Tremont rivers into the Crescent. Despite these many settlements, some chose to live on their own among the peaceable, if perilous, creatures of the forest, among the emerald leaves of summer, among the scent of garcei flowers, alone with the wind and one with nature.</p><p>The sun had just risen over the canopy, and the plump wellings warbled their songs from their mud nests in the creeks. They sang for the delicious grass growing on the field and between the stones of the creek. Others sung for the delectable spix that floated with the glinting Dust that filled the air. And yet other wellings sang for the Dust that settled on and warmed their mud brown feathers.</p><p>Some abruptly quacked and dove under the water at the rush of paws along a riverbank. A pack of quartolf rushed by and howled at the sight of sauntering ajax, and in their pursuit, separatedthe sunlight into rainbow streams with their crystalline hides. The ajax broke branches from the trees with its enormous antlers as a means of hindering the quartolf and churned up the soil with its sharpened hooves to trip their paws. After minutes of pursuit, a quartolf lunged, the ajax wailed and tumbled. The Quartolf had their meal.</p><p>Deep beneath the earth, a golem slumbered still, turning about and shaking the stones above.Peblud skittered away under their mineral shells, afraid of an earthquake squashing their exoskeletons. A net swept across them and scooped them up. They writhed and squirmed to escape the threads, all to no avail. The net swung level with the squinting eyes of a young boy, no more than ten. He scrunched his nose. “Rocks with legs.” He stuck out his tongue. “And Ma wants to make soup out of them.” He hitched the net over his shoulder and paced away from the gravel field and toward a glade beyond the next rows of trees. “Those quartolf are lucky…”</p><p>He hiked up his loose-fitting trousers and stuffed the loose coattail of his red shirt into them, then harrumphed and ran toward the trees, narrowly avoiding stepping on the laces trailing on his shoes. He emerged into the glade and hop-skipped over the pond the pet wellings loungedin. </p><p>The cabin beyond the lake stood at a single level, with a loft at the top forming a peak. Greenish smoke drifted from the chimney and spread Dust from the concentrated sparkwood across the glade, causing hundreds of garcei blooms to sprout.</p><p>The boy hurriedly ran around back to the wooden slat fence and stone groundwork at the back of the cabin. Curled up underneath a low roof was a ball of sleek, black fur, roughly as large as the boy himself.</p><p>The boy peeked through the slats and grinned, pulling a peblud out from the net. “Kairus…” he said in a drawn-out way. The fur stirred, and a V-shaped head shot up from it, revealing a pair of black eyes and a pink nose, just above the small mouth and below the floppy, round ears.</p>",

Stray tiktoks hooted overhead as they returned to their hivenest, ferrun mewled in their stalls as they waited for their masters’ coming for the night.</p><p>The setting sun shone through the dusty windows of a little shop in the corner of the walls of Hereb. Swords, spears, axes—weapons of all sorts stood against the racks along the walls, each shining, some brand new, and others chipped and battered. Opposite the solid oak door was a walk-around counter, and beyond that intricately decorated rifles sat on pegs along the walls, each proudly displayed. Some small, some large, others with empty oil canisters, and others more with crystal chambers waiting to be filled. </p><p>A grizzled man wearing simple clothes beneath a grease-stained apron sat in front of a desk in the back. On the weathered desk sat a long drawer set filled with coils, gears, rods, ignitions, along with a scattering of other bits and bobs across the desk itself. In the center of it all was a tekna pistol in the midst of construction, with the barrel disconnected from the handle and all the delicate insides out for the world to see.</p><p>The man squinted his eyes and set a pair of spectacles on the bridge of his nose. Using a pair of tweezers, he wove a narrow rubber tube into the workings and connected the oil canister with the ignition chamber. He then pulled an opaque white crystal from a drawer and slid it in front of the firing pin. He set down his tweezers and put the cover plate over the insides, then clicked the barrel into the stock. With that, the pistol was whole.</p><p>The man grinned and disconnected the empty oil canister, then replaced it with a full one on the desk. He turned the fill valve and after a second, turned it back. He aimed it at the wick of an unlit candle across the room, then fired. The firing pin struck the crystal, sending activated Dust into the oil. The oil boiled and exploded, shooting out of the barrel and forming a thin bolt of light. It shot across the wick of the candle, lighting it, then the bolt struck a ceiling beam and left a smoking black scar.</p><p>The man chuckled and began polishing the barrel with a dirty rag. “Fine shot, as always.” A bell rang, and the man turned around and absentmindedly said, “Welcome to Old FolksWeaponry, finest selection of new and used weapons, including handcrafted—” He stopped upon seeing the customer. He pulled off his spectacles and stared in amazement at who had just walked into his establishment. </p><p>His head was in the shape of an otter’s, complete with the short ears, large nose, and long whiskers, down to the sharp canines in his mouth. Slick, grizzled fur coated his body, from his large barrel chest to his stout tail. He wore a coarse linen kilt, an open green vest and a necklace made of numerous sea shells and trinkets. A pair of large axes hung from a thick leather strap across his shoulder, the handles nearly scraping the ceiling as he paced around the room.</p><p>The orna inspected the weapons racks curiously, rubbing his scruffy chin as he scraped his bare pads on the floor. His tail hung back as he pulled a sword out from the rack and swung it, twisting it around and getting a feel for its weight.</p>",

Stone piled high on the weathered tables around him, and jars and bags of sparkling Runik Dust stood amongst them, exuding their magical aura. Behind the man was an upright bench supporting a jumble of boulders in the loose shape of a human. To the left, supported by another upright bench, was another humanoid construct with made from carved granite and coated with clay. Lines of Runik Dust crisscrossed over a portion of the stone left uncovered by the clay, occasionally sparking in the air.</p><p>The man brushed back his oily hair and sighed. He kneaded the clay in the bowl and stretched it, ignoring the flecks now stuck on the top of his head, then stood up and applied it to the joints of the construct. When the clay melded into the joints, he scooped his hand into a bucket on the floor and dunked another handful of clay into the bowl. </p>The man returned to the table and pulled a polished sphere of limestone from the center of the table up to the edge. Carefully etched lines spidered across its surface, all filled with the glowing Runik dust save for the top. After carefully brushing specks of gray dust from the surface, the man took a brush from a bowl of Runik dust and began carefully filling the emptyengravings with it. His hand bumped into a half-filled glass of water as he worked, tipping itscontents over a half-eaten sandwich and draining n a plate. But he continued his work, not caring about the ruined lunch.</p><p>A trail of violet mist swirled into the room from an open window. It gathered together behind the man into a cloud, then solidified into a transparent, human figure. He appeared as an old man wearing rags, except the edges of his body continued emanating the ever-present mist.</p><p>He scowled at the scruffy young man with disdain. “Ahem,” he coughed in a warping voice. The man didn’t respond.</p><p>The man of mist groaned and pulled out a spherical crystal emanating a pulsing, crimson light. “Ahem.” Again, no response.</p><p>The man of mist shouted in frustration and threw the crystal at the man. “Lyrom!” The crystal clouted the man over his head and landed on the soggy sandwich, completely undamaged. </p><p>Lyrom fell forward and grunted in surprise, then groaned and rubbed the back of his head. He looked up and shook himself, then gasped, staring carefully at the sphere to ensure the Runik dust wasn’t disturbed. It remained within the lines he so carefully carved despite the sudden jolt.</p><p>He sighed and picked up the brush. “Eion, you nearly ruined my golem’s brain.” He turned and noticed the crystal. Chuckling, he set down the brush, then picked the crystal up from the sandwich. “But at least you brought a Life crystal. I was wondering how much longer it would be till I had a core.”</p>",

In the clearings that cropped up between the emerald green, crystalline wolves darted in and out of the shade, chasing moss-covered deer for their meals. Plump, black birds with webbed feet gathered in the winding rivers and ponds, warbling cheerily as they rooted through the mud for grubs and worms. </p><p>In one of these clearings stood a simple cabin, and behind it was a small garden, laden with frilly leaves, blue fruit and yellow tubers. A fence around it stood guard against the hundreds of puffy silver rabbits that lurked in the undergrowth, waiting for the gardener to forget the gate just once.</p><p>Rows of grimy glass jars balanced on the posts of the fence, each reflecting the bright sun where the dust refused to settle. A lazy green beetle wove around them, searching for a potential meal.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A burst of white light struck a jar and scattered it across the ground, forcing the beetle to flee back into the protective trees. From behind a wall of barrels laden with preserved fruit, a boy wearing simple brown clothing popped out and ran to the glass shards, carrying with him a small rifle loaded with a energy-filled crystal in its chamber.</p><p>He shuffled the glass around the short blades of grass with a shoe that was little more than a leather sock. He sighed and leaned against the fence, allowing his frizzy blonde hair to flop over his green eyes. “Can’t ever do anything fun…”</p><p>The door of the cabin creaked outward, and a lean man with gloves stuffed in his pocket emerged. He studied the boy for a moment, then scratched the dark blonde stubble across his chin, looking down. Finally, he smiled and walked up to him, leaning against a post himself.</p><p>The man noticed the glass on the ground and said, “Practicing with your new rifle, Erik?”</p><p>The boy sighed and replied, “Yeah….”</p><p>The man frowned. “You don’t sound like you’re having fun.”</p><p>“Dad, it just that…that I want to do something more useful than shooting jars,” Erik added. He held up the rifle and continued, “I could be out shooting ajax in for dinner, or shooting one of those lagos that keep trying to come in. Why won’t you let me?”</p><p>His father looked up for a moment. “Mostly because I wasn’t sure if you’d harm the garden, oraccidentally shoot someone coming along the path.” He picked up a shard of the jar and tossed it in his hand. “Though, judging from this, you’ve gotten better since your birthday. I think you might be ready to help me out.”</p><p>Erik beamed and stood straight. “Really?”</p><p>His father nodded. “Yep. The wellings have been eating the new plucard I’ve planted, and it’s not like they need any more food.” Turning aside, he muttered, “Pudgy black birds…”</p><p>Erik saluted with his rifle and stamped his foot. “I’ll watch for any wellings and have them for dinner if they come down!”</p><p>His father laughed and tussled his hair. “That’s my boy!” He walked back to the door and said, “I’ll be getting my gar ready to fish at the river. Be careful!”</p><p>“I will!” Erik shouted, returning behind the fruit barrels and peeking between the gaps.</p><p>The father chuckled and gently shook his head. “Might mistake a welling for a visawk, but I’m sure he’ll do fine.” He closed the door, leaving Erik to his watch.</p><p>Erik scanned the skies, attempting to pick out the lumbering flocks of birds from the fluffy white clouds that filled the azure background. He didn’t flinch when the green beetle returned to the jars, nor when a puffy silver lagos peeked its head out from the fringes of the deciduous woods. Nothing diverted his attention for even a moment.</p>",

Standing within the dark, rich soil near the center, moss clung onto the bark of trees, barely surviving on the limited sunlight—and the vibrations of the wooded home.</p><p>An almighty tree, with arms thicker than a man and height several stories high, stirred. Its canopy rustled, its roots jostled, and branches quavered. Near the top of the tree, a rough-featured face—made with a blocky nose, jawline, and eyebrows—twisted and contorted.</p><p>The eyes opened, revealing pale yellow sclera and green irises. A groan emanated from the tree, and its roots tore up from the ground and stepped forward, scattering the birds resting above. It did the same with its other foot, and the sprat nesting underneath squeaked in terror and dove into the undergrowth.</p><p>The tree groaned once more and lowered its arms with a crack, then twisted its head, cracking more. It turned back around, facing the distant light it knew to be at the edge of the forest. It narrowed its eyes, then stomped forward. Ajax emerged from the shadows and joined him, walking slowly with him. He stomped again, and the ajax’s predators, the quartolf, joined him, uncaring of their meals standing with them.</p><p>The tree continued forward, and with every step, more species of the West Kaena Woods, ranging from the insignificant sprat and ceroachs to the great visawks that watched from above. The woods shifted from night to twilight, then twilight to daytime. The fringe of the forest came into view, granting a glimpse of the plains beyond.</p><p>The tree did not look back at his entourage of nature, but he knew they were there, for he called them. In a deep, guttural voice, he said, “Our domain…has been violated…and now…we will help man…understand…that even nature…has a voice…once more…” The animals with him continued in silence, knowing well the truth in his words. </p><p>Knowing the truth of the rynth.</p><p>~~~~ </p><p>At the edge of the woods, in the bright afternoon, a group of men worked around a fallen true with blue wood on its inside. Two focused on uprooting the stump at the edge, another two peeled off the bark with scrapers, and another two prepared a metal sled and tied ropes onto its hooks.</p><p>A heavyset man wearing a pale yellow jacket read through a tattered paper nailed to a board. He sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose. “The mayor ought to know that we’ve already cut down an azurewood this month.” He eyed the signature on the board. “This won’t look good with election coming up.”</p><p>The ground shook beneath them, and all the men stop their work, looking around them. The ground shook again, and they dropped their tools. The crown of the rynth rose above the young trees around it, and animals flooded out into the plains, running around the men and their work. They shouted and screamed, scrambling out of their way.</p><p>The yellow-coated foreman stepped back, oblivious to the rushing wildlife. All he saw was the enormous tree marching forward, keeping pace with the wildlife in his grand sweeping strides. He swung his arms forward, building up momentum and quickening his pace toward a walled-in village deeper in the plains. Moss fell from him in great droves as he and his army marched toward the unaware town.</p>",

The tides sparkled in the night, and the dozens of lights along the coastline joined it. Pale white kramon lazily swam through the water, and wellings quacked peacefully in their sandy nests. Ships of all shapes and sizes lined up against the coast and docks jutting out from it. To the north, pale green light glowed at the horizon, its source unseen. All through the air, glittering white dust hovered in the air, replacing the stars for light.</p><p>Among the dozens of wooden buildings standing on the coastline, many had lanterns hanging from hooks at their door, while others lit the windows of the homes. Few walked the gravel roads at this time of night, with only the occasional man lumbering from one house to another for a night’s rest.</p><p>One building, however, was full of activity: The Bloated Visawk, with a sign that depicted a miserable black-feathered bird inflated to a ball. Raucous laughing filled the air around the half-open door, and cups clattered as drinks were passed around. </p><p>A man wearing little more than a shirt and pants stumbled out, half-waving to his comrades as he stumbled and tripped over the step. He recovered before he fell, then laughed as he tottered to a moored ship at the dock.</p><p>A shrouded figure brushed past him, then drew his brown cloak closer. He continued into the tavern, narrowly avoiding stepping on shattered glass with his bare paws. The light of the metal chandeliers above revealed the light-grey snout peeking out of the hood of his cloak. His pointed ears twitched at the sudden laughter erupting from the scattered tables, all filled with men of all classes. Some slumped over the table with a stein in hand, and others engaged in arm wrestling, with a pile of coins going to the winner.</p><p>The figure approached the bar of the tavern, where a man with a bushy brown beard stood polishing a mug with a gray rag. He eyed the figure suspiciously, studying him from the cyan eyes under the hood to the tail hanging limply from his rear.</p><p>The man shrugged and proceeded to fill the mug from a tap with a brown, frothy drink. “Pretty far from any lykai territories. You a loner?”</p><p>The lykai sat on a stool, resting his head on his hand. He tossed a coin onto the counter, which the bearded man quickly tucked into his filthy apron. </p><p>The man set the mug in front of him with a clank and stepped away. “Ah, the quiet sort. Sorry if I was bothering you. Just don’t see many of you in these parts.”</p><p>The lykai sat upright and sipped at the ale, revealing a leather gauntlet around his wrist, and an intricate black flame with a spiral in its center etched on the back of the hand. A grungy man with peppered black stubble took notice and scooted next to the lykai. “Hey, you’re one a’ those lykai people, aren’t ya?” The lykai didn’t respond.</p><p>The grungy man continued, wrapping around the lykai’s shoulder. “Aw, don’t be shy. Can’t you do all that magicky stuff?” Again, the lykai didn’t respond, choosing instead to tighten his grip on the handle of his mug.</p><p>Another man wearing a plaid red shirt hunched over and said, “You heard the rumor about a bunch of ghosts roaming ‘round here? Heard they were searching for some lost treasure or somethin’ like that.”</p><p>A heavy-set man commented from another table, “You mean Eidoloc? Nah, they be searchin’ for an heir of some castle. Line o’ succession and all that.”</p>",

Stray tiktoks tittered as they ruffled their feathers for the night, and plowff nestled in their underground dens, shielded from the light of the sparkling white dust in the sky.</p><p>The brisk wind brushed across the figure’s dark gray fur. He drew his cloak tighter around him, tighter against the leather clothing he wore.

Help me to rid these thoughts from my mind.’ He remained still moments after, collecting his thoughts.</p> <p>A weight settled on his shoulder. He gasped and spun around, coming face-to-face with another wolf-life face, only with light-gray fur. His leather clothing had a similar set of symbols across it, and his eyes were a far deeper blue than his own.</p><p>He threw his arms in the air and exclaimed, “I’ve been looking everywhere for you, Arthus! Why are you so far out from town?”</p><p>Arthus stood up on his bare paws and replied, “Matheus, you know that lykai like us need to have time to think for ourselves out in the wild.” He scratched the back of his head and added, “That, and…well, I didn’t want to be around after I tricked that Mored guy.”</p><p>Matheus laughed and wrapped an arm around Arthus’ shoulders. “You just didn’t want to be lifted up and congratulated for kicking out the biggest bully in town.”</p><p>Arthus lurched away and exclaimed, “Hey, you beat him up a good deal before I did! If I remember right, I had to come in before they broke your face in!”</p><p>“Yep. And I knew you’d come in to rescue me.”</p><p>“That doesn’t mean you should’ve done it!

                    "sampleContent": "<h4>Short Story: Fallen Wings</h4><p>Under the bright morning sun, beyond the coarse coastline along the shifting tides, a few dozen houses cropped together. A low wind blew through, throwing mist up onto the bare sand. Cawing and quacking echoed from above, while an occasional crab scuttled back and forth out of the waves. Away from the coastline and toward an islet in the center of the wide cove grew an enormous tree over half a mile wide, with massive roots digging deep into the soil and sea. Large boughs stretching high into the sky splitting into hundreds of branches, all large enough for a man to stand comfortably on the soil the top bark contained.</p><p>A black shape flew high in the skies—an aeran. His claw-like feet hung behind as he flapped thegreat red wings on his back. Dull red feathers covered his body, from his legs and arms to his chest and head. He wore a loose shirt and pants of finely woven gray moss, strong enough to withstand the snapping wind above.</p><p>He drew closer to the tree and clacked his matte yellow beak in satisfaction. A brown moss bag fluttered at his side, beating against his yellow clawed hand. He joined others of his kind returning from their destinations, with some also bearing boxes, bags, or other such things from their customers. Multicolored feathers, clothing, beaks, and claws made the flock, paired with many sizes and shapes. Many more flew between within the canopy and around the trunk, hopping between the homes made from discarded tree branches to taps ingrained in branches yielding fountains of fresh, sweet water. Others cultivated diverse crops in the soil of the branches, while some dove into natural holes in the trunk to rooms made in the deep bark of the marvelous tree.</p><p>At the end, the red aeran entered a large plaza, the center of the tree where the eight central boughs all connected. Constant chatter echoed throughout the tree as crops were cared for and deliveries were made, alongside the many other tasks that had to be completed throughout the tree.The red aeran joined the fray and flew above the plaza and followed the south-eastern bough, weaving through the branches as they progressively got smaller and the environments became progressively less crowded. This continued until he ended only large enough for two men to stand side-by-side. At the end, a cylindrical structure made from a solid length of branch stood two stories tall, hollowed out and carved with simple symbols across the bark.</p><p>Arlen entered through the open door and exclaimed, “I’m home!” The room was simply made, with one half devoted to a kitchen and pantry, and the other to a set of covered chairs and a table. A staircase wove along the walls to the second floor. </p><p>Arlen stood next to the table and inspected a note resting on it: </p><p>‘Arlen, I’ve gone to get fruit. Sim hasn’t come out today. Talk to him, please. ~ Heleen’.</p><p>Arlen set the note down, then turned back around, noticing a red scarf hanging from a pole next to the door. He frowned and shook his head. “Simwell…” He crossed the room and ascended the stairs, coming to a hallway split into two rooms. He came up to the door on the right, which had several black feathers pinned to it with sap.</p><p>He knocked on it and said, “Sim? I know you’re in there.” He waited, but no response.</p><p>He pushed the door open, where a small black Aeran with a yellow beak and claws sat on a straw bed facing a window. The aeran wore gray moss clothing, completely closed from the back. No wings emerged from it.</p><p>Arlen paused, then watched the window and saw other young aerans flitting through the branches, laughing as they went off to do their chores. He sighed, then said, “You can’t stay inside forever, Sim.”</p>",

                    "sampleContent": "<h4>Short Story: Guardian Rynth</h4><p>In the bright orange sunset of the evening, the trees of the East Kaena Wood rushed in the low breeze. Shrubbery crowded around the few paths throughout the forest, while the canopy blocked much of the light, leaving it in an eternally gloomy state no matter the time of day. Crystalline quartolf darted in the shadows with the rest of their pack, hunting down the wiry ajax for a meal. Songbirds tittered in the canopy, wellings quacked in their mudbanks, and tiktoks swarmed together in the treetops, ever watchful for their next target as they hooted amongst themselves.</p><p>Down in the underbrush, a sprat hopped past, brushing its bushy orange tail across the ground and leaving an amber trail of dust in its wake. It constantly sniffed the air and kept its beady black eyes open for predators. It wove into a small hole beneath the ground and into the tunnels beneath, speeding toward the light that it knew lay at the end.</p><p>The ceiling rumbled, and the sprat froze, unsure of what was happening. Soil fell, and the sprat rushed even faster toward the exit. It neared the end of the tunnel, but the ceiling caved in right on top of it, trapping its body just before it could get to freedom. Its head lay uncovered, hyperventilating as it struggled to get free.</p><p>A shadow descended and blocked the light. The ceiling rumbled once more, and an enormous, wooden hand pried it up. Another hand swept away the dirt around the sprat, then gingerly picked it up, holding it high above the ground.</p><p>The sprat calmed once it saw its rescuer: a tree over ten feet tall, with ropes of woven grass looped all around his bark body and bags of leaves hanging from knots and burls. Small holes retreated deep into his body, which housed nests complete with mother and chicks within, while his thick leaf-laden crown sagged over his amber eyes, studying the sprat carefully.</p><p>The ancient mouth creaked open and said, “Young spratling…you are not meant to tread tunnels…remain in the bushes and feed…so I do not have to save you once more…” The sprat sniffed in agreement, and the tree lowered it to the ground for it to run off into the undergrowth.</p><p>The tree straightened and remained still listening carefully. When the birdsong returned, he turned around and hastily marched through the forest, rustling his leaves and shaking the nests within him.</p><p>A mother silverling squawked and leered outside of her nest. The tree turned his head and nodded. “Yes, yes, I’ll slow. Ilm Lightwood is not a rynth to disturb your rest.” His march turned into a walk, and his body stopped shaking. The silverling cooed quietly and ducked her head back into her nest, settling over her young chicks.</p><p>The rynth continued to march through the woods until the gloomy dimness turned into utter blackness. At that time, he ventured deep into the center, where the trees grew large and thick, until he came to a circle of tall, tightly knit trees, with seemingly no way into the grove for even a sprat.</p><p>Ilm waved his hand toward them. Two trees creaked and groaned, forcing their roots forward and coming apart making a narrow entrance for the rynth. He passed through carefully, and the trees returned, settling back into their growth.</p><p>Above, the canopy was free of leaves, allowing the light of the full moon to shine. The branches of the wall of trees came together into shelves, perches, and bowls for the many animals that rested there. Birds of prey tucked their heads under their wings as young fish swam in the pools of water, sprat kicked their legs in their sleep within intricate cages of living branches, all while young ferrun curled up in the sheets of warm moss.</p>",

The almighty Crescent River flowed through the center of the wood, and along the embankments, many small villages, towns, and even a city at the joining of the Slipclaw and Tremont rivers into the Crescent. Despite these many settlements, some chose to live on their own among the peaceable, if perilous, creatures of the forest, among the emerald leaves of summer, among the scent of garcei flowers, alone with the wind and one with nature.</p><p>The sun had just risen over the canopy, and the plump wellings warbled their songs from their mud nests in the creeks. They sang for the delicious grass growing on the field and between the stones of the creek. Others sung for the delectable spix that floated with the glinting Dust that filled the air. And yet other wellings sang for the Dust that settled on and warmed their mud brown feathers.</p><p>Some abruptly quacked and dove under the water at the rush of paws along a riverbank. A pack of quartolf rushed by and howled at the sight of sauntering ajax, and in their pursuit, separatedthe sunlight into rainbow streams with their crystalline hides. The ajax broke branches from the trees with its enormous antlers as a means of hindering the quartolf and churned up the soil with its sharpened hooves to trip their paws. After minutes of pursuit, a quartolf lunged, the ajax wailed and tumbled. The Quartolf had their meal.</p><p>Deep beneath the earth, a golem slumbered still, turning about and shaking the stones above.Peblud skittered away under their mineral shells, afraid of an earthquake squashing their exoskeletons. A net swept across them and scooped them up. They writhed and squirmed to escape the threads, all to no avail. The net swung level with the squinting eyes of a young boy, no more than ten. He scrunched his nose. “Rocks with legs.” He stuck out his tongue. “And Ma wants to make soup out of them.” He hitched the net over his shoulder and paced away from the gravel field and toward a glade beyond the next rows of trees. “Those quartolf are lucky…”</p><p>He hiked up his loose-fitting trousers and stuffed the loose coattail of his red shirt into them, then harrumphed and ran toward the trees, narrowly avoiding stepping on the laces trailing on his shoes. He emerged into the glade and hop-skipped over the pond the pet wellings loungedin. </p><p>The cabin beyond the lake stood at a single level, with a loft at the top forming a peak. Greenish smoke drifted from the chimney and spread Dust from the concentrated sparkwood across the glade, causing hundreds of garcei blooms to sprout.</p><p>The boy hurriedly ran around back to the wooden slat fence and stone groundwork at the back of the cabin. Curled up underneath a low roof was a ball of sleek, black fur, roughly as large as the boy himself.</p><p>The boy peeked through the slats and grinned, pulling a peblud out from the net. “Kairus…” he said in a drawn-out way. The fur stirred, and a V-shaped head shot up from it, revealing a pair of black eyes and a pink nose, just above the small mouth and below the floppy, round ears.</p>",

The almighty Crescent River flowed through the center of the wood, and along the embankments, many small villages, towns, and even a city at the joining of the Slipclaw and Tremont rivers into the Crescent. Despite these many settlements, some chose to live on their own among the peaceable, if perilous, creatures of the forest, among the emerald leaves of summer, among the scent of garcei flowers, alone with the wind and one with nature.</p><p>The sun had just risen over the canopy, and the plump wellings warbled their songs from their mud nests in the creeks. They sang for the delicious grass growing on the field and between the stones of the creek. Others sung for the delectable spix that floated with the glinting Dust that filled the air. And yet other wellings sang for the Dust that settled on and warmed their mud brown feathers.</p><p>Some abruptly quacked and dove under the water at the rush of paws along a riverbank. A pack of quartolf rushed by and howled at the sight of sauntering ajax, and in their pursuit, separatedthe sunlight into rainbow streams with their crystalline hides. The ajax broke branches from the trees with its enormous antlers as a means of hindering the quartolf and churned up the soil with its sharpened hooves to trip their paws. After minutes of pursuit, a quartolf lunged, the ajax wailed and tumbled. The Quartolf had their meal.</p><p>Deep beneath the earth, a golem slumbered still, turning about and shaking the stones above.Peblud skittered away under their mineral shells, afraid of an earthquake squashing their exoskeletons. A net swept across them and scooped them up. They writhed and squirmed to escape the threads, all to no avail. The net swung level with the squinting eyes of a young boy, no more than ten. He scrunched his nose. “Rocks with legs.” He stuck out his tongue. “And Ma wants to make soup out of them.” He hitched the net over his shoulder and paced away from the gravel field and toward a glade beyond the next rows of trees. “Those quartolf are lucky…”</p><p>He hiked up his loose-fitting trousers and stuffed the loose coattail of his red shirt into them, then harrumphed and ran toward the trees, narrowly avoiding stepping on the laces trailing on his shoes.

Curled up underneath a low roof was a ball of sleek, black fur, roughly as large as the boy himself.</p><p>The boy peeked through the slats and grinned, pulling a peblud out from the net. “Kairus…” he said in a drawn-out way. The fur stirred, and a V-shaped head shot up from it, revealing a pair of black eyes and a pink nose, just above the small mouth and below the floppy, round ears.</p>",
