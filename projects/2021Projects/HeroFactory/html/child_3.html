            Hey everybody! Sam Stanger and I'm a culinary design artist! I
            specialize in making foods based on dishes and cuisines from movies,
            TV shows, videogames, books, you name it! I'm professionally a chief
            in a small catering department and have obtained permission to serve
            some of my fan-art dishes to at various events such as comic-cons,
            award ceremonies, birthday and holiday events, and even graduation
            parties.<br /><br />
            I'm also skilled in coming up with fantasy recipes of my own and
            have allowed others to us them in their works. You know the weird
            alien burrito thing that they eat in <em>Orion: Constellation Hunter</em> and the characters can't
            seem to get enough of it? That was me. You know the stew  is
            served in the seventh episode of <em>Justice is Served</em>? That was also me! Check out
            my Pinterest, Instagram, and Facebook! If you want to reach out to
            me, here's my work email! cda_sam_341@gmail.com

            What's up internet world?! My name is Jonny and videogame designing
            has been a hobby of mine for 7 years now! Unity and other videogame
            developing platforms have become by backyard playground and I know
            all the tricks to them! Though I'm not the best artist out there in
            terms of drawing and imagining; if you give me a character and some
            animations, I can make him or her become an awesome playable
            character to whatever kind of game you want!<br /><br />

            Hi! My name is Emily and I'm an art major at BYU-Idaho! My favorite
            class was "Color and Design" which I apply every day in my life. I
            do a lot of painting and have been doing it since I was 8! I've done
            all kinds of projects: gallery paintings, murals, portraits,
            magazine designs, etc. Though I spend a lot of time in my studio, I
            love collaborating with others and working alongside others who want
            to fill the world with color!<br /><br />
