          Hi! My name is Kire. Though I am an animator by trade, I also
          have experience with creative writing, illustration, music composing
          and performing, and web design. Referring back to animating, I got my
          degree in Animations from BYU. I've worked in several animation industries that
          focused on 2D cartoon animations for children's programs.<br /><br />Note:
          Kire L. Elrid is my pen name and I currently have not graduated yet
          nor worked in any animation industry of any sort. I am not intentionally
          fabricating my identity, I simply am chronologically impaired.

          It has been over fifteen years since the rebel forces and the
          government of [name] started the 7th Season of War. Those on neither
          side are tired of the bloodshed and unrest that has become a
          normality. It is up to eight unexpected characters to put an end to it
          all, but such a worthy cause hasn't crossed the minds of any of them.
          Regardless of the fact that each of them has a part to play in the
          war, they each have their own desires to fulfill, their own life to
          live, their own tale to tell.<br /><br />

            other characters, ending with Florence (bounty hunting botanist); who carries the mantle of
            "main character" throughout the rest of the main trilogy. "The
            stories were originally starting projects to get my creativity
            flowing at the start of my journey as a story teller, but after
            deeper consideration, I fell in love with the characters I created
            and had to help them progress to greater heights in their own
            world." (Kire L. Elrid)

          up more on the "world" aspect behind it all and ignore the "story" and
          even the "character" aspect when day dreaming about gimmicks of my
